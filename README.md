# Github Issue Notes Theme

## [Live demo](https://github-issue-notes-theme.vercel.app)

## How to deploy

First of all make sure you use a private repo because in a public repo anyone will be able to make issues & they will appear on your site.

* Fork the project or download
* Open theme.config.js file and change username and repo name
* Get a personal access token from github
* Deploy the vercel and TOKEN as env variable
* That's it enjoy
